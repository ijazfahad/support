Synchronizing your data with GivePulse
Last updated on 08/24/2023




By uploading csv files to our secure FTP server, you can quickly import and synchronize your service learning courses, students, faculty and staff with GivePulse. We run a nightly job to update course rosters and import new courses, students and faculty. You can create the files manually or export them directly from Banner or any other software platform you are using. Data sent over in each of the files is a refresh of the new data, not the delta (or changes). 
Set Up Information
sFTP Data We Need from You - Generating a Public Key
We use public/private key authentication for sFTP and need a public key to grant you access to your account. 


Steps to generate an ssh key
1. Open terminal (on a mac) or (git bash on windows) 
2. run the following command
        > ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<your_email@school.edu>"
3. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," type out the path that is there but replace the file name (id_rsa) with givepulse_id_rsa
4. Do not enter a pass phrase. Just hit enter.
5. Two files will be created: 
         > givepulse_id_rsa - your private key
         > givepulse_id_rsa.pub - your public key
6. Send the public key to support@givepulse.com. We'll add it to our sftp server and you can now connect to it using your private key
sFTP Variables We Will Provide You With
   * IP Address or DNS 
   * Port
   * Username - Will most likely be your organization name


Live vs Test Environments


In your sFTP directory you will find two folders: Production and Test. Production will be synchronized with the main GivePulse site. Test will be synchronized with dev.givepulse.com. You must sync your information in the Test folder and review it on your dev site before syncing it on Production. When you place your files in Test folder, email support@givepulse.com and let them know so that they can begin syncing. Following that you can review your files in dev.


Accessing Your Dev Site
Accessing dev requires an additional username and password. For information on finding and accessing your dev site, please review this document.  


Data Encryption
GivePulse supports GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) Encryption. This information is published on the Open PGP Key Server under support@givepulse.com, and the fingerprint for our key is: 8524 5A99 5036 A5FD ABF1 4929 E74B D018 D77B A502 - You can download it from here as well: https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=support%40givepulse.com.


You can use our public key to encrypt your data before sending it.
Uploading your data


Command line or script - You can connect by running
sftp -oPort=xxxxx  {subdomain}@sync.givepulse.com


If you need to whitelist an IP for sync.givepulse.com, you can use one of the following:
   * 3.220.245.96
   * 52.223.3.13
   * 35.71.172.193


FileZilla or some other FTP client
  

Important Notes


   1. Please use the exact file names and column header names. Any changes to the header or file names may result in that column/file being ignored.
   2. Columns can be placed in any order and any optional column can be omitted from the csv if you do not need or use it.
   3. File names must be the following: students.csv, instructors.csv, courses.csv, course_students.csv, course_instructors.csv, terms.csv and memberships.csv
   4. Emails: An institution can have students, graduate students, student workers, staff, employees, faculty, alumni and other types of users with unique type of emails. In order to ensure GivePulse works smoothly, it’s very important that the emails sent in these files are the ones where the user will receive actual email and it should also match up to any SSO email that comes across to GivePulse. Please discuss this in the onboarding.
   5. In the instance you want to add custom fields beyond what is not listed on here in the documentation, the labels should have a title with the format of CF_XXXX where XXXX is the GivePulse ID. Please ask the system administrator for GivePulse on your institution to create admin custom fields for the user. Learn more about proper custom field formatting here.
   6. If you are using a delimiter other than “,”, please let us know.
   7. Data Syncing Settings: under the More Tools > Data Syncing within your group, there are a number of settings designed to help you manage and audit your data integration with GivePulse. Here’s some important functionality included: 
   1. Log files
   2. Admin email frequency 
   3. Setting up default admins for the courses
   4. Course title formatting on the frontend of users
   5. Student subgroup placement

Notes related to each field

STUDENT_ID: For Student IDs that have trailing zeros: we recommend double checking and making sure the files are consistent when moved back over to GivePulse. Common issues occur when opening files in MS Excel and the zeros disappear
PREFERRED_NAME: Preferred first name if different
EXPECTED_GRADUATION: yyyy-mm-dd or just the year YYYY (will sync to Graduation Year in GP if just the year) - Maps to Graduation Date in the GivePulse UI
EXPECTED_GRADUATION_TERM: Maps to Graduation Date in the GivePulse UI
CURRENT_YEAR: Freshman, Sophomore, 2nd Year, etc
CF_XXXX: Click here for instructions on custom field creation and formatting
EMAIL2: If all of your users have two emails, you can send the second one here and it will be attached to their account. This will reduce duplicate user accounts from being created if they can log in via SSO with either email address
EMERGENCY_CONTACT_REL: accepted values -> Parent|Mother|Father|Spouse|Partner|Fiancee|Sibling|Child|Son|Daughter|Stepfather|Stepmother|Grandparent|Uncle|Aunt|Cousin|Relative|Neighbor|Roommate|Friend|Mentor|Boyfriend|Girlfriend|Other|Unknown

NOTE: In the case there are fields you may want to add for reporting purposes, please inform our team and we can work on custom mappings of those fields.
                
Additional Notes on File Structure
Course Primary Administrator


The primary administrator of a course is by default the primary administrator of your network (unless you’ve selected a “Course Parent Group” to place all the courses under via the Data Syncing Settings page. In that case, the primary administrator will by default be the organizer of that group). 


You can change this behavior by the following two options: 
   * Setting the FACULTY_ID or GIVEPULSE_ORGANIZER_ID in the courses.csv file on a course by course basis OR
   * Setting the “Default Organizer ID” in the Data Syncing Settings via the GivePulse User Interface as shown below:
  



So who will be made the primary organizer of a given course?
   1. If the FACULTY_ID or GIVEPULSE_ORGANIZER_ID is set in courses.csv then this person will be.
   2. If not 1, then if the “Default Organizer ID” is set, they will be the primary organizer
   3. If not 1 or 2, the Primary Organizer of the parent group where the courses are placed


Instructors - Secondary Administrators


Instructors are added as secondary administrators. You can have up to 3 course instructors (excluding the primary organizer). These are added through the course_instructors.csv file. 




________________


SSO Lookup


For institutions that are using Single Sign-On (SSO) w/ GivePulse (Shibboleth or CAS) we support user data lookups when a new user logs in for the first time. We pre-populate the new user’s GivePulse profile with any data found in the student file or faculty and staff file. Additionally you can pass in their SSO username in the students/faculty files and we can do a lookup on that when they log in via SSO.




________________


________________
Custom Field Syncing
To include additional information about students and instructors, you can create custom fields. You can add as many additional columns for custom fields as you like. Custom fields column headers should be formatted as 'CF_XXXX' - where 'XXXX' is the custom field ID generated by GivePulse. 


YOU MUST CREATE THE CUSTOM FIELD IN GIVEPULSE IN ORDER TO GET THE CUSTOM FIELD ID. If you are syncing fields to your dev environment first, be sure to create the custom fields in dev and use those IDs in your test files. When you are ready to sync files in production, you will need to recreate your custom fields and add the production custom field IDs to your files.


Note that the fields you sync are locked in GivePulse and will only be updated via the syncing job.


Please see the instructions below for how to properly create custom fields, retrieve the custom field ID, and update your files.
Creating the Custom Field in GivePulse
To create custom fields for your users (students/faculty), go to Customize > Users > Administrative Fields within your group dashboard.
  

Here, you can create all of your custom fields. If you're creating a field with multiple options, make sure the options you create in GivePulse match the options you have in your files.
   
Find Custom Field ID
Once you've created the custom fields, you will now have to retrieve the custom field IDs. You can find the custom field IDs under More Tools > Custom Fields in your group dashboard.
  

Here, you can do a keyword search for the fields you created and find the IDs in the Field ID column.
  

Add Custom Field ID to Files
Now that you have the custom field ID, you can update your files and format the column header CF_XXXX.
  





________________


Course Generation


Courses are uniquely identified by the TERM and CRN number. Those two fields are used to see if the course exists in GivePulse. If not found, that course will automatically be created and placed under the main GivePulse group, or under the optional parent group if PARENT_GIVEPULSE_ID is set. Note that the PARENT_GIVEPULSE_ID must correspond to a GivePulse group in your network. You can also set a default group location by setting the Course Parent in the Ftp Syncing settings via the GivePulse UI




Course Updates
If you want an existing course description to be updated during a sync, you must set it to “_” in GivePulse so that we know it should be updated.




________________


Course Naming Convention


Courses are by default named with the following format:


{CRSE_TITLE} ({CRSE_NUMB}) [- Section {SECTION}]


If SECTION is not sent to us, then  [- Section {SECTION}] will not be included.


You can customize how titles will be generated on your data syncing settings page by navigating to your group > manage > resources > data syncing (note you must be a top level admin)


Available attributes for generating course names are:


{CRSE_TITLE} {CRN} {SUBJ_CODE} {CRSE_NUMB} {TERM} {DEPT_CODE} {SECTION} and {FACULTY_NAME}






________________


Deleting Data


We do not automatically delete courses or students or instructors from the system.


For example, if a student/instructor/course record is delivered one week but not the next, the record will remain in the database, untouched! It simply means you are no longer syncing that data.


You may choose to archive users in the system (which will hide them) if you no longer want them active and you can reach out to support (support@givepulse.com) if you need any courses physically removed from the system.


________________


Synchronizing Course Students and Faculty


Note that we only process a course roster if
   1. The course is listed in the course file and
   2. The course is not marked as completed in GivePulse.


For each course found in the courses.csv file that is not marked as completed in GivePulse, all of the students and faculty are grabbed from the course_students.csv and course_instructors.csv files and linked to that course. Any person found in GivePulse that is linked to the course and not in those two files are removed.
